  <h2 >Martin Luther King Jr.</h2>
 <p>
 Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968) was an American Baptist minister and civil rights leader who became one of the most prominent figures in the fight against racial segregation and inequality in the United States. He is best known for his role in advancing civil rights through nonviolent activism, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's principles of nonviolence.
 </p>
 <ul>
 <h2>Early Life</h2>
<li>Birth: Martin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia. His birth name was Michael King Jr., but his father, Michael King Sr., later changed both their names to Martin Luther King to honor the German Protestant reformer Martin Luther.</li>
<li>Family: King was born into a middle-class African American family with strong roots in the church. His father, Martin Luther King Sr., was a Baptist minister, and his mother, Alberta Williams King, was a schoolteacher. King was influenced by the religious and social justice activism that surrounded him.</li>
<li>Education: A gifted student, King skipped two grades and entered Morehouse College in Atlanta at the age of 15. He graduated in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology. He later earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania and a Ph.D. in Systematic Theology from Boston University in 1955.</li>
 </ul>

<ul>
<h2>Early Activism and Leadership</h2>
<li>Montgomery Bus Boycott: King first gained national attention in 1955 when he led the Montgomery Bus Boycott after Rosa Parks, an African American woman, was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white person on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. The boycott, which lasted for over a year, resulted in the desegregation of the city's buses and established King as a prominent leader of the civil rights movement.</li>
<li>Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC): In 1957, King co-founded the SCLC, an organization that aimed to harness the power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests for civil rights. As the SCLC's president, King traveled across the country, speaking and organizing demonstrations to advance civil rights.</li>

  <h2>Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
<p>
Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948), born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who became the leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule. He is internationally recognized for his philosophy of nonviolent resistance, known as "Satyagraha," which inspired civil rights movements around the world.
</p>
<ul>
<h2>Early Life</h2>
<li>Birth: Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a coastal town in present-day Gujarat, India, to a Hindu family. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, was the chief minister of Porbandar, and his mother, Putlibai, was deeply religious, instilling in him values of compassion and nonviolence.</li>
<li>Education: Gandhi was an average student but was deeply influenced by the stories of Indian religious figures. At 19, he went to London to study law at University College London and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1891.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<h2>Return to India and Leadership in the Independence Movement</h2>
<li>Return to India: Gandhi returned to India in 1915, where he was soon recognized as a leader in the Indian National Congress. He began organizing peasants, farmers, and urban laborers to protest against excessive land taxes and discrimination.</li>
<li>Champaran and Kheda Movements: Gandhi's first major achievements in India were in Champaran and Kheda in 191718, where he led successful campaigns against oppressive land policies.</li>
<li>Non-Cooperation Movement: In 1920, Gandhi launched the Non-Cooperation Movement, urging Indians to boycott British institutions, including schools, courts, and goods. The movement marked a significant shift in Indian politics, bringing millions into active resistance against British rule.</li>
<li>Salt March: In 1930, Gandhi led the famous Salt March to the Arabian Sea to protest the British monopoly on salt. This act of civil disobedience galvanized the Indian independence movement and attracted global attention.</li>

  <h2>Nelson Mandela</h2>
<p>
Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His presidency marked the end of decades of institutionalized racial discrimination and ushered in a new era of reconciliation in South Africa.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Early Life</h2>
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in the small village of Mvezo, in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province. He belonged to the Thembu royal family of the Xhosa-speaking people. Mandela's father was a local chief and a counselor to the Thembu royal family. Mandela was the first in his family to receive a formal education, attending local missionary schools before enrolling at Fort Hare University, where he began his studies toward a Bachelor of Arts degree.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Anti-Apartheid Activism</h2>
Mandela's activism against apartheid, the South African government's policy of racial segregation and discrimination, began in earnest after he moved to Johannesburg in 1941. There, he became involved in the African National Congress (ANC), a political party advocating for the rights of black South Africans. In 1944, Mandela, along with other young activists, founded the ANC Youth League, which called for more radical and militant tactics to end apartheid.
</p>

<p>
Mandela's work with the ANC led to his involvement in campaigns of civil disobedience, boycotts, and protests. Over time, he became a leading figure in the fight against apartheid. In 1961, Mandela co-founded Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the armed wing of the ANC, and began to organize sabotage campaigns against government targets.
